Testing methods.

1. Start the sever use web browsers to visit sites. Both using HTTP and HTTPS.
   I normally use chrome. So I would open F12, and under networks label, I would
   read the responses Chrome received.

2. I read my log file to test any logical bugs. I record the steps when any
   fd's get read, written or closed, to see if anything happened out of order.

3. I run a client sock and sent sample requests and print what the sever gives
   back.
   Things like:
    GET /images/abc.png HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.cs.cmu.edu
    Connection: keep-alive
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.99 Safari/537.36
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
