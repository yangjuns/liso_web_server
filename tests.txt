Testing methods.

1. Start the sever use web browsers to visit sites. Both using HTTP and HTTPS.
   I normally use chrome. So I would open F12, and under networks label, I would
   read the responses Chrome received.

2. I read my log file to test any logical bugs. I record the steps when any
   fd's get read, written or closed, to see if anything happened out of order.

3. using test scripts in scripts/

    example_client.c: This is used to act like a client. It reads requests
        from request text files and sent it to the sever and print the response
        from the sever. Some requests ask for large files like png files to test
        server's ability to send large files over the net.

    cgi_script.py: This is used to act like a cgi. When the sever receives
        requests that involve cgi, I first try this script to see if the server
        calls cgi correctls.

    ssl_script.py: This file is used to test ssl request. It sends normal
        requests but over SSL connection to test HTTPS requests.
