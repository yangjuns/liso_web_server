1. The sever is design to support at most 10 pipelined requests. And it assumes
   that the request doesn't contain POST request. If a post request is in the
   pipelined requests, although the server detects it but the buffer might not
   be large enough to hold the request.

2. If the client sends pipelined requests and one of them is bad request. The
   server will generate separate responses. The number of responses is equal to
   the number of requests the parse thinks it is. But if the client sends a GET
   request, with request body(which is a bad request). The parse will thinks it
   is one good request followed by one bad request. So it will generate two
   responses instead of just one 400 response.

3. Memory leak.
